## About Us

Chainroot is a team of highly experienced professionals dedicated to developing an integrated, seamless blockchain infrastructure platform. Our mission is to simplify and enhance blockchain interactions through innovative solutions and services.

## Our Services

- **Blockchain Explorer**: We provide explorers for multiple chains with propagation times of less than 5 seconds, ensuring rapid and efficient access to blockchain data.

- **Advanced Analytics**: Our platform offers in-depth analytics to help users gain valuable insights into blockchain activities and trends.

- **Knowledge Base**: We maintain a comprehensive repository of documents, public nodes, and snapshots to support our users' needs.

- **GraphQL-Based Data Access**: We offer GraphQL-based access to our indexed data, along with real-time streaming options to the database of your choice.

## Validator Infrastructure

At Chainroot, we prioritize security and high availability in our validator operations:

- **Horcrux for Remote Signing**: We utilize [Horcrux](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/horcrux), a multi-party computation (MPC) signing service, to enhance the security and availability of our validators. This approach involves distributing the signing process across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of single points of failure.

- **High-Tier Data Centers**: Our infrastructure is hosted in top-tier data centers, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

- **Backup Firewalls**: We have implemented redundant firewall systems to safeguard against unauthorized access and ensure continuous protection.

- **Intrusion Detection with Wazuh**: We employ [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/), an open-source security monitoring solution, for both host-based (HIDS) and network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) across all our servers. This setup enhances our threat detection capabilities by monitoring system activities and analyzing network traffic for potential security incidents.

## Monitoring Stack

To maintain the health and performance of our infrastructure, we have established a robust monitoring system:

- **Prometheus and Alertmanager**: We employ Prometheus for metrics collection and Alertmanager for handling alerts, enabling proactive monitoring and incident response.

- **Tenderduty**: Our setup includes Tenderduty to monitor validator duties and ensure timely performance.

- **CVMS**: We utilize the Cosmos Validator Monitoring Solution (CVMS) to oversee validator operations and maintain network integrity.

- **Notification Integration**: Alerts and notifications are seamlessly integrated with Slack, Discord, and Tenderduty, ensuring our team remains informed and responsive to any issues.

## Open Source Contributions

We believe in the power of open-source collaboration and have actively contributed to public repositories such as [cosmos-kit](https://github.com/cosmos-kit) and [Cosmostation's CVMS](https://github.com/cosmostation/cvms). Our commitment to the open-source community remains strong as we continue to support and advance these projects.

## Current Operations

- **Blockchain Explorer**: Our explorer currently operates on over 20 chains, providing users with comprehensive and up-to-date blockchain information.

- **Validator Services**: We serve as validators on more than 5 chains, ensuring network security and integrity through our reliable validation services.
